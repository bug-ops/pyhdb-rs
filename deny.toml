    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack on RSA (timing sidechannel)
    # Safe to ignore: we only use RSA for JWT signature verification with PUBLIC keys
    # from JWKS endpoints. The vulnerability affects private key operations (signing,
    # decryption) over network, which we do not perform. Our use case is a resource
    # server validating tokens, not generating them.
